# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This file is not edited by hand. Every change writes its own fragment under
`.changes/unreleased/` with [chlog](https://github.com/luizjhonata/chlog), and a release compiles
the pending fragments into a version section here — so two branches each adding an entry no
longer touch the same lines, and a rebase that used to conflict on this file now conflicts on
nothing.

## [Unreleased]

## [4.0.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** added an **Identities** tab, and made a contributor row a *person* rather than an account. Every system this plugin measures identifies people differently — a commit-author address or a login, a WakaTime username, an Atlassian account id — and only a shared e-mail joins any two of them on its own. Keyed by account, one human occupied three rows that each held a third of the story. The new screen lists every account the plugin has seen, links it to a catalog `User`, and ranks who else it might be: an identical address, the same local part on a different domain, an identical display name, a username matching the directory address, a partial name match. An address that matches a `User` profile is linked automatically, because that is the same rule the catalog uses; everything weaker is offered and linked only when a person confirms it, because two people who share a surname would silently become one contributor and a merge nobody asked for is far harder to notice than a row that stayed separate. A manual link is never overwritten by the automatic rule. Links are applied when a row is built rather than when a measurement is taken, so correcting one is retroactive across every window ever collected, and an account nobody has linked keeps a row of its own rather than vanishing.
  **BREAKING CHANGE:** `ContributorSummary.key` is now a person key — the catalog `User` reference when linked, `<source>:<sourceKey>` otherwise — where it used to be the bare commit-author identity, and the type carries a new required `identities` field naming what was merged. Anything reading `key` as an e-mail address or a login has to read `identities` instead. `RepositorySummary.wakaTimeMetrics` is now a `WakaTimeProjectMetrics` rather than a `WakaTimeMetrics` — a smaller shape, because WakaTime reports languages and editors per person per day and never per project, so a per-repository breakdown would have to be invented. The `code_health_contributor_metrics` table is replaced by `code_health_contributor_measures`, keyed by source as well as by day; its rows are dropped rather than migrated, because the WakaTime payload they held has a shape no reader can parse any more and the next snapshot pass rebuilds the whole window anyway
- added a `/api/code-health/v1/capabilities` route and a matching `codeHealthIntegrationsApiRef`, so the dashboard asks the backend which optional integrations are configured before it draws anything. Inferring it from whether any row happened to carry a value could not tell a switched-off integration from one that is on and has not collected yet — the two want completely different words on the screen — and it made a freshly configured install look broken until the first nightly pass. Every integration column group is now a factory the table calls only when its flag is set, so nothing is built for an integration that is off
- added a Confluence integration that measures documentation work at two levels: per person (pages created, pages edited, versions authored, blog posts, comments, attachments, spaces touched, words written and page views) and per space against the repository whose catalog entity carries the `confluence.io/space-key` annotation (total pages, activity in the window, contributors, last edit, stale pages, the single stalest page and pages with no parent). It runs on the daily snapshot schedule through the shared Atlassian client, so the browser never talks to Atlassian and one API token lights up Jira and Confluence together. Three modelling decisions are worth knowing: written volume is measured in **words**, not lines, because Confluence serves no diff between two versions and no per-edit change size anywhere in its API — the unit rides on the payload the way `ContributorSummary.churnUnit` does, so a run that could not afford to fetch page bodies reports `null` rather than a zero that would read as "this person wrote nothing"; **page views are Confluence Cloud Premium only**, so the first refusal is treated as a verdict about the whole site, views stay `null`, and the dashboard says which of "refused", "not collected" and "measured" happened; and the space report counts **parentless pages** rather than orphan pages, because Confluence Cloud exposes no backlink query at all and half a definition should not be named after the whole of it. Every account seen is reported to the Identities screen by Atlassian `accountId` — the same handle Jira uses — so linking once puts a page, a ticket and a commit on one contributor row. Operator documentation is in `plugins/code-health-backend/docs/confluence.md`.
- added AI authorship and token counts from WakaTime, behind `codeHealth.wakaTime.includeAiMetrics`. This is the only place any system in this plugin can report a token count: WakaTime's editor plugins observe whether a line was typed or accepted from a completion, and no version control provider knows the difference. The contributors table gains prompt and completion tokens with the split beneath, and the share of added lines attributed to AI with the prompt count beneath; Insights gains both as fleet figures. It is off by default and catches up a few days per run because it is the expensive half — coding time for a whole window costs one request per member, while the AI figures come from the durations resource, which answers for a single day at a time. That means AI history accumulates forwards from the day it was switched on rather than being backfilled, which the documentation says out loud because a chart starting in the middle otherwise reads as a bug. When the resource refuses — a plan that does not serve it, an editor plugin too old to report it — the fields stay null, which says "not collected"; zeros would say nobody used AI, which is a different and false claim
- added Jira delivery metrics at two levels — per person and per repository — collected by a background enricher on the daily snapshot schedule and served to the dashboard, so the browser never talks to Atlassian. Per person: tickets closed and raised, interactions broken into comments, worklog entries and status transitions, story points completed and assigned, average cycle and lead time, and reopened work. Per repository: throughput per week, median and 85th-percentile cycle time, bug ratio, backlog size with the age of its oldest ticket, and the open backlog by priority. Repositories are scoped to a project by a `jira/project-key` annotation and optionally narrowed by `jira/component`, so a repository whose entity names no project has no row rather than a row of zeroes — several repositories legitimately track no work in Jira. A project named by several repositories is queried once and the answer shared, and the fleet aggregates count it once. Story points live on a custom field whose id differs per Jira site, so it is resolved by name at runtime and can be pinned with `codeHealth.atlassian.jira.storyPointsField`; when it cannot be resolved the figures are null and render as an em dash, never as a zero. Cycle time is an average on the contributors table and a median on the repositories table, because identity linking merges a person's several Atlassian accounts onto one row and medians cannot be combined while totals can. Sprint completion rate is deliberately absent: the public Agile API reports a sprint's current issues rather than its committed scope, so any figure computed from it would disagree with the sprint report the team is reading

### Changed

- changed the Claude workflows to call the reusable workflows in `rios0rios0/pipelines` instead of `rios0rios0/.github`, which is where every other reusable workflow and composite action already lives, and renamed them to `claude-review.yaml` and `claude-mention.yaml`, matching the `reusable-claude-review.yaml` / `reusable-claude-mention.yaml` definitions they call
- documented the release under AutoBump 3.0.0. Releases are cut with `autobump .` — the `local` subcommand is gone, and the `-c` that used to be mandatory is not, because AutoBump no longer searches the working directory for the operator's configuration and so can no longer mistake this repository's `.autobump.yaml` for it. The `yarn.lock` refresh that keeps the bump from tripping YN0028 is now `refresh: true` under `languages.typescript` in the operator's own configuration, replacing the old `refresh_commands` block — which must be **deleted**, because 3.0.0 recognises the removed key by name and aborts rather than ignoring it. That setting stays the operator's rather than moving into this repository: AutoBump 3.0.0 owns the command, but whether a package manager runs at all is not something a repository gets to decide, so a project file may switch the refresh off and never on.
- moved the lockfile refresh into this repository's `.autobump.yaml`. `refresh: true` now sits under `languages.typescript`, beside the `version_files` pattern that makes it necessary: that pattern moves the caret range the frontend and the backend declare on `-common`, and the same string is a resolution descriptor `yarn.lock` keys on, so a bump that moved one without the other desynchronised them and every CI job's `yarn install --immutable` answered `YN0028`. AutoBump previously read `refresh` from a project's own file only when it was `false`, so the flag had to live in each releaser's `~/.autobump.yaml` -- and when it did not, the release still went out and the lockfile was repaired by hand afterwards, as it was for 2.3.0, 3.0.0 and 4.0.0. It is a fact about this workspace's build rather than a preference of whoever is releasing, so it now travels with the repository and holds for everyone. Requires AutoBump with project-layer refresh (rios0rios0/autobump#348).
- refreshed `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/skills/code-review/SKILL.md` to cover the WakaTime, Jira, Confluence and Sonar integrations and the Identities/`PersonDirectory` model, which had landed in `CLAUDE.md` only: a contributor row is a person resolved on read, only an e-mail match links automatically, integration columns are gated on `/v1/capabilities`, and the `/identities` tab sits last
- rewrote the WakaTime integration. It collected two numbers from an endpoint that does not exist — an organisation reached through `/orgs/{org}/members`, where WakaTime actually hangs members off a dashboard — and stored them as one rolling 30-day total, so a range picked over a past month reported the last thirty days relabelled with that month's dates. It now walks `/users/current/orgs/{org}/dashboards` to its members, addresses each by their member id rather than their username (getting that wrong returns empty summaries for everybody rather than failing), and stores a measurement per day, so the range picker gets a real answer. With no organisation configured it measures the key's own account, which is what a small team on personal plans wants. The contributors table gains coding time with its daily average, active days as a share of the window, the language somebody spends most time in, branches touched — including ones that produced no commit, which is the difference between this and anything the repository can tell you — and files opened, which stays empty rather than reading zero on the plans WakaTime does not report it on. Repositories gain the coding time logged against their matching WakaTime project, matched by name or by a `wakatime.com/project` annotation, with a repository nothing matched reporting empty rather than zero because "nobody here has WakaTime installed" and "the project is called something else" are different problems. Insights gains a card for where the fleet's attention went: the categories WakaTime records (coding, debugging, code reviewing, writing tests), the language and editor breakdowns, who spent the most time, and which repositories received it — the only section on that tab that measures effort rather than output, since a version control provider never sees the afternoon that produced no commit

### Fixed

- restored the `.changes/unreleased/` directory with a `.gitkeep`, so the release tooling keeps recognising this project as [chlog](https://github.com/luizjhonata/chlog)-based after a release consumes the last fragment. Git tracks files rather than directories, so the bump commit that removed the final fragment removed the directory too, and the next run read the empty `[Unreleased]` section as "nothing to release"
- restored the `id-token: write` permission on both Claude workflow callers. Without it the caller grants less than the reusable workflow declares, which GitHub rejects before the job starts -- runs ended in `startup_failure`. The action needs the scope because `setupGitHubToken()` exchanges a GitHub OIDC token for the GitHub App token it posts with, unless a `github_token` is passed explicitly.

### Removed

- removed the unused `id-token: write` permission from the Claude workflow callers, and changed `claude-review.yaml`'s display name to `Claude Review` so it matches its file name and its `Claude Mention` sibling. `anthropics/claude-code-action` needs `id-token: write` only for workload identity federation or the Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry OIDC paths; these authenticate with `claude_code_oauth_token`, so the scope allowed minting OIDC tokens for any audience without ever being used.

### Security

- raised `browserslist` to `4.28.8` and `fast-uri` to `3.1.6`, both through `resolutions`, to clear five advisories `sca:yarn-audit` began failing on. `browserslist` was locked at `4.28.6` (GHSA-c83g-rgw3-j3cx, unbounded memory growth via distinct query results; GHSA-73wf-gq98-2v4g, uncaught crash or prototype write via untrusted `browserslist-stats.json`) and `fast-uri` at `3.1.5` (GHSA-5jgf-p345-68v8 host confusion via skipped IDN canonicalisation, GHSA-f65p-4m7j-42xc and GHSA-fph4-wmhf-6fwf server-side request forgery via malformed IPv6 normalisation and repeated hostname percent-decoding). Both reach this workspace transitively, and the existing `fast-uri` resolution pinned `^3.1.4` -- below the `3.1.6` that fixes it. `3.1.7` exists but is a day old and `npmMinimalAgeGate: '7d'` holds it back, which is the gate working as intended.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- added a **Catalog APIs** card to the Insights tab, and an **API** column to the repositories table, flagging repositories that ship an OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, GraphQL or protobuf definition and declare no `spec.providesApis`. A definition found in the repository is reported as a fact with its path; a component merely typed as a service is kept apart as the weaker signal, so an inference never dilutes a real finding
- added a **Documentation** card to the Insights tab, and a **Docs** column to the repositories table. It separates repositories that publish TechDocs from ones that already write documentation nobody wired up — a `docs/` tree, an `mkdocs.yml`, a link out to a wiki — from ones with nothing at all, because the first gap costs one annotation and the second costs somebody sitting down to write. Both cards name the repositories rather than only counting them
- added a **Today** range and a calendar-month picker to every tab's toolbar. "Today" is the local calendar day so far, which is a different question from "the last 24 hours" and gives a different answer at nine in the morning. Choosing **By month…** in the same dropdown reveals a month and a year selector with arrows either side, so any month the backfill has reached is at most two clicks away; months outside the ingested history stay visible but unselectable, so a gap reads as "not collected yet" rather than as a list that mysteriously starts in April
- added a shallow repository file scan behind both audits — the root, `docs/` and `api/`. On GitHub the three trees ride along in the snapshot's existing GraphQL document and cost no extra request at all; on Azure DevOps it is one listing per repository per day, plus one for each of those two directories that exists
- added a tailored `code-review` skill under `.github/skills/` so GitHub Copilot reviews changes against the [rios0rios0/guide](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki) standards and this repository's own load-bearing invariants
- added fleet test-coverage figures to the Insights tab: the average and the median coverage per repository, how many sit below SonarQube's default 80% gate, the distribution across four bands, and a ranking of the least-covered repositories. The mean is unweighted so a small untested repository is not hidden behind one large well-tested service, and the median sits beside it because a mean over a long tail says little on its own
- added the catalog facts both audits read (`backstage.io/techdocs-ref`, `spec.type`, `spec.providesApis`, documentation links) to the tracked repository row, written by discovery. They change when somebody edits a YAML file rather than on the snapshot's schedule, and re-reading them per dashboard load would put a catalog query back on the request path this design exists to keep clear

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** moved **Insights** to the plugin root and repositories to `/repositories`. Insights leads because it is the only tab that answers a question about the fleet rather than about one row of it, and it is what someone opening the plugin cold wants first. An app deep-linking to `/insights` must link to the plugin root instead, and `codeHealthPlugin.routes.insights` is now `codeHealthPlugin.routes.repositories`
- changed `codeHealth.defaultRange` to accept `today`. A specific calendar month is deliberately not accepted: it would be a fixed month that goes stale the moment it passes
- changed the approval-rate and pipeline column headings to carry a tooltip explaining what each divides. Both are ratios whose numerator and denominator the heading does not name, and a reader who guesses wrong reads the column backwards: the approval rate is how somebody votes when they review, not how their own pull requests fare, and the pipeline rate covers runs requested for them
- changed the changelog to [chlog](https://github.com/luizjhonata/chlog) fragments: a change now writes its own YAML file under `.changes/unreleased/` through `chlog new --kind <Kind> --body "..."`, and `CHANGELOG.md` is GENERATED from them at release time by `chlog batch auto && chlog merge`. That is the one thing a single shared file cannot do — two branches each adding an entry no longer touch the same lines, so a rebase that used to conflict on `CHANGELOG.md` now conflicts on nothing. The 14 entries standing under `[Unreleased]` were carried across one fragment each, word for word and in their original order; the migration was verified by compiling the fragments back with `chlog batch` and diffing the result against the file they came from, so the next release renders the same document. The single entry marked `**BREAKING CHANGE:**` carries `breaking: true`, which under SemVer is the only thing that bumps the major — a kind never does. AutoBump already reads the fragments directly, so the release flow is unchanged.
- changed the contributors table's **Lines of Code** column to **Code churn**, which reports the unit the provider actually gave. Azure DevOps reports changed *files* and exposes no line count anywhere in its REST API, so that column showed `0` and `+0 / -0` on every row of an Azure DevOps fleet — which reads as "nobody wrote any code" rather than as "the provider never said". Every row now prints its own unit, and the existing history lights up without re-ingestion because the file counts were already being stored
- changed the contributors table's single **Approved PRs** column into **PRs created** and **PRs approved**. One column headed "Approved PRs" over a review count conflated two different questions: how much work somebody opened, and how much of other people's work they reviewed
- documented why a bump leaves `yarn.lock` behind and how the release is unblocked: `.autobump.yaml` moves the caret range the frontend and the backend declare on `-common`, which is also a resolution descriptor in the lockfile, so every CI job's `yarn install --immutable` answers `YN0028`. The fix is a `refresh_commands` entry in the operator's global `~/.autobump.yaml`, which cannot live in this repository's own config — AutoBump reads that file out of the repository being released and drops executables declared there. The manual fallback is recorded alongside it for anyone on an older AutoBump

### Fixed

- fixed refreshing replaying the window a rolling range was selected with rather than re-reading the clock. "Last 24 hours" kept asking for the same 24 hours however many times it was refreshed, so the numbers never moved although the toolbar said they had; a dashboard left open overnight kept reporting yesterday as **Today**, and never offered the month it had just entered. The refresh button and the auto-refresh timer now advance the clock, and the new window is what triggers the fetch
- fixed the `main` pipeline, which every repository's `sast:gitleaks` job had been failing since the code-review skill landed: the skill's own security bullet listed credential prefixes verbatim to warn against writing them, and the scanner's second pass matches those prefixes on their own, so the warning tripped the rule it was describing. The bullet now names the vendors instead, and the commit that carried the original wording is allowlisted by fingerprint in `.gitleaksignore`, because the scan walks the whole history reachable from `HEAD` and no edit at the tip can clear a past commit. No credential was ever committed.
- fixed the help tooltips on the contributors table being unreachable without a pointer, and invisible to assistive technology. An SVG has no focus event for the tooltip to open on, and Material UI stamps `aria-hidden` on any icon carrying no `titleAccess`, so the explanations existed only for people using a mouse

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- added `catalogEntityPath` and `parseEntityRef` to `@rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health-common`, so a stored entity reference resolves to its catalog page without the frontend taking a dependency on `@backstage/plugin-catalog-react`
- added `entityRef` to `ContributorSummary`, resolved by `ListContributorSummaries` against the catalog through a new `findUsersByEmail` on `CatalogReader`. Matching is by profile e-mail and nothing else — bots, service accounts and commits authored from a personal address stay unlinked rather than being guessed at by name — and a matched catalog `User` supplies the display name and picture in preference to whatever the provider reported
- added a fleet-wide time series: `GetRepositoryTimeSeries` now treats `repositoryId` as optional and aggregates every tracked repository when it is omitted, served from a new `GET /timeseries` route. Asking per repository and summing in the browser would mean one request per repository on every range change
- added a review-load ranking, which answers a different question from the commit ranking. Review work concentrating on one or two people is the readable form of a bus factor problem and is invisible on a chart of who commits
- added an **Insights** tab with the fleet-level figures a manager reads rather than the per-repository rows the other two tabs carry: six headline tiles (active repositories, active contributors, commits, merged pull requests, build success rate, review coverage), a delivery-cadence chart, top contributors and most active repositories by commits, a review-load ranking, and quality-gate and branch-policy breakdowns
- added an `insights` sub route, so an app can deep-link to the tab the way it already can to contributors

### Changed

- changed contributor rows to show the catalog user's picture, falling back to their initials when the entity carries no `spec.profile.picture`
- changed the repository name in the repositories table to link to that repository's catalog entity rather than reading as plain text, which is the page a reader wants from a row on a Backstage dashboard
- refreshed `CLAUDE.md` to correct the frontend API-wiring count: the stateless client is now registered behind four data refs (repositories, contributors, coverage, time series), not three, after the time-series ref landed with the Insights tab

### Fixed

- fixed every `KnexCodeHealthStore` test failing in CI with "Could not locate the bindings file" by passing `install_run_scripts: true` to the shared workflow. The pipeline started installing with `--mode=skip-build` on 2026-08-18, which leaves `better-sqlite3` without the native addon `TestDatabases` needs to open a SQLite database

### Security

- pinned `nanoid` to `3.3.18` to close `CVE-2026-67213`, a HIGH-severity denial of service where a custom generator loops indefinitely when the requested size is zero. It arrives transitively through `postcss`, and the advisory was published against a lockfile this repository already had — the resolution pins the patched version per line rather than suppressing the finding

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- added `technicalDebtMinutes` to `SonarMetrics`, carrying `sqale_index` as SonarQube reports it alongside the formatted `technicalDebt` string. The formatting is lossy — it drops the residual minutes once there are whole days — so summing two debts cannot work backwards from the display value
- moved `formatDebt` into `@rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health-common` and exported it. The collector and the contributor aggregation now format the same value with one implementation instead of two that would drift

### Fixed

- counts sum, because a contributor spanning three repositories carries all three. Percentages average, because adding coverage figures is meaningless. The quality gate takes the worst value present, so one failing repository stays visible instead of being averaged away. A contributor whose repositories have no Sonar project still reports `null` rather than a row of zeroes
- fixed the contributors view rendering its Sonar columns permanently empty. `ListContributorSummaries` hard-coded `sonarMetrics: null`, so `BUGS`, `SMELLS`, `HOTSPOTS`, `VULNS`, `COVERAGE`, `DUPS` and `DEBT` were shown for every contributor and could never hold a value. They now carry the Sonar health of the repositories that contributor touched inside the window
- this is deliberately not an attribution. SonarQube measures projects, not people, and nothing here claims the bugs belong to anyone — two people working the same repository see the same figures. It answers "what does the code this person worked on look like", which is the only honest reading of a per-project measure on a per-person row

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- added a log line reporting how many entities collapsed onto a repository another entity already named, pluralised for the single-entity case. Without it the only symptom is a dashboard with repeated rows and nothing anywhere explaining why

### Fixed

- fixed one repository being tracked once per catalog entity that names it, which rendered an identical dashboard row per entity and made every scheduled task re-fetch that repository once per row. Two shapes hit this: a monorepo declaring one component per module, and a single location file declaring many components, since all of them inherit the same `backstage.io/managed-by-location`. Discovery already intended to collapse them — the guard and its comment were there — but it deduplicated on `TrackedRepository.id`, which is a hash of the entity reference and therefore unique per entity by construction, so the check compared entities to themselves and could only ever collapse an entity duplicated within a single pass. Deduplication now keys on the repository's own coordinates via a new `repositoryIdentity()`, folding case because both providers treat those segments case-insensitively and the same repository reached through an annotation and through a source location can differ only in spelling
- fixed the entity owning a shared repository being able to change under the tracked row, which would have taken the dashboard's history with it. `syncRepositories` keys on `id` alone and `id` derives from the entity reference, so any change of winner inserts a new row and soft-deletes the old one, resetting the backfill cursor. The entity already tracking a repository now keeps it whatever its reference, so adding a component later cannot take the repository from the one that has been ingesting it; the lowest reference decides only when no candidate is the incumbent — a first discovery, or the incumbent leaving the catalog — which keeps that choice independent of the order `CatalogReader.listEntities` happened to return
- fixed the existing regression test passing for the wrong reason: it built both fixtures with the same `metadata.name`, so they were one entity rather than two naming one repository, and it exercised the identity collapse that `EntityBuilder`'s own documentation warns about. It is replaced by cases that fail against the previous implementation — two components on a monorepo, several components on one Azure DevOps repository, one repository reached through two different annotations, and a repository staying with its incumbent when a lower-referenced component appears later

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- added `.autobump.yaml`, so a release writes the new version to the three published packages and not only to the private workspace root. AutoBump's TypeScript defaults know one `package.json`; in a workspace that is the one file npm never sees, and `delivery-publish` compares the release tag against each published package's own `version`, so a bump that missed them would have failed the guard three times over
- added `@rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health-backend`, the plugin that turns Code Health from a browser-side dashboard into a proper Backstage plugin. It owns a database, a scheduler and the credentials, so the browser stops talking to version control providers entirely. This first piece brings the schema, the store, the health route and the repository discovery task
- added `@rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health-common`, the package that will carry the HTTP contract between the frontend and the incoming backend plugin. It owns the types both sides exchange, plus the pure helpers that derive presentation state from them — `computeComplianceColor`, `computeBadgeColor`, `parseBadgesFromReadme` and `formatDuration` all moved there rather than being duplicated. Having one package own the contract is what stops the client and the server drifting apart, which is the failure mode a hand-synchronised copy in each package eventually reaches
- added `freshUntil` to the coverage response: the instant _every_ tracked repository has data through, rather than the point the luckiest one reached
- added a hand-rolled in-memory IndexedDB double (`test/doubles/stub_indexed_db.ts`), since jsdom ships none and the key store is the one place a lost key silently invalidates every stored credential. It keeps the real `CryptoKey` across opens, so a test can prove a token encrypted before a reload still decrypts after one
- added a rate-limit-aware provider gateway that every request now passes through. It caps concurrency per host and total requests per run, retries `429` and `5xx` with jittered exponential backoff, and opens a circuit breaker on a host that keeps failing. Most importantly it reads `Retry-After` and the `X-RateLimit-*` headers on **every** response rather than only on errors: Azure DevOps applies throttling as latency on a successful `200` and sends those headers _before_ it starts delaying, so a client that inspects them only on failure misses the entire warning and keeps pushing until it is blocked outright. That is what produced the throttling and `5xx` this release exists to fix
- added a time range picker bounded by what the backend has actually ingested, alongside a backfill progress bar. Without them a freshly installed plugin looks broken: it can only answer for the last day, and nothing on screen distinguishes that from a failure
- added activity aggregation over the stored events rather than over a pre-aggregated table, so a change of definition — counting a partially-succeeded build as a success, say — reinterprets the whole history instead of only what is ingested afterwards
- added an operations section to the README covering the three scheduled tasks, the scheduler's own control plane for triggering them, and how long a first backfill actually takes at the default budget — roughly four days for five hundred repositories, or under a day with `backfillChunk: P7D`
- added collectors for Azure DevOps and GitHub that read a date-bounded window in a fixed number of requests. They authenticate through the host application's existing `integrations` configuration, so the Azure DevOps token is no longer duplicated anywhere. Two API defaults are overridden explicitly because both hide most of the data: Azure DevOps returns only _active_ pull requests filtered on _creation_ time, and its build query applies the time window to whichever timestamp `queryOrder` names
- added cursor discipline that treats a failed window as unfetched: the cursor moves only after the events, the days covered and the cursor itself are committed together, so a crash or a provider error is retried rather than leaving a silent hole in the history. Days are recorded as fetched only when a window covers them end to end, which keeps the incremental phase from claiming a part-day
- added repository discovery from the Backstage catalog. Repositories come from catalog entities and nothing else: the plugin resolves each one through `github.com/project-slug` or `dev.azure.com/project-repo`, falling back to `backstage.io/source-location` matched against the host application's configured integrations. Nothing is enumerated from a provider API any more, which is what removed the per-load cost of listing every project and repository in an organisation
- added Sonar enrichment through `@backstage-community/plugin-sonarqube-backend` over the internal service-to-service channel, so the Sonar token stays where that plugin already keeps it and no second credential is configured here. Sonar history cannot be backfilled through that route — it exposes a current summary per entity and no measures-history passthrough — so the trend begins at the first snapshot after installation rather than at the retention floor
- added tests for everything the coverage config previously hid: the plugin definition, both entry points, the route and API refs, the DI wiring in `main/apis.ts`, the tab router, and the IndexedDB key store. `collectCoverageFrom` now excludes only files that compile to no executable statements (entity shapes, port interfaces, GraphQL/REST node types), so the reported number describes the whole package instead of a chosen subset
- added the background ingestion actor, which runs in two phases against one shared request allowance. The **incremental** phase moves each repository's forward cursor towards now, so a freshly installed plugin answers for the last day on its very first run; only what is left of the allowance goes to the **backfill** phase, which walks each repository backwards a chunk at a time towards the retention floor. That ordering is what lets the selectable range widen from today outwards while the dashboard stays current throughout
- added the daily snapshot task, which captures the state no provider reports retroactively: compliance checks, README badges, the branch list, the latest release and tag, and Sonar measures. On GitHub that is one GraphQL document per repository, replacing three separate requests the browser used to make _per dashboard load_. On Azure DevOps the project's branch policies are fetched **once per project** rather than once per repository — forty repositories in a project previously downloaded one identical payload forty times, which was the single largest source of avoidable traffic
- added the ingestion schema: repositories mirrored from the catalog, per-repository cursors, one indexed table of dated events, the days already fetched, and daily current-state snapshots. The fetched-days table exists so that "no activity" and "not fetched yet" stay distinguishable, which is what lets the dashboard tell a user which range it can actually answer for
- added the read API the dashboard runs on: `GET /v1/repositories`, `GET /v1/repositories/:id/timeseries`, `GET /v1/contributors`, `GET /v1/coverage` and `POST /v1/refresh`, all mounted under `/api/code-health`. Every route serves from the database, so a dashboard load costs the same whether ten people or a thousand are looking at it, and whether the catalog holds ten repositories or a thousand
- added WakaTime enrichment reading `codeHealth.wakaTime.apiKey` from backend configuration. It runs once per pass for the organisation rather than once per repository, and the key is declared `@visibility secret` so it never reaches a browser
- added window validation that bounds every query to the retention period. An unbounded `from` would make one request scan the whole event table, which any signed-in user could have triggered by editing a URL

### Changed

- changed `@backstage/frontend-plugin-api` from `^0.16.0` to `^0.17.3`, which is what `@backstage/core-plugin-api@1.12.8` and `@backstage/core-compat-api@0.5.13` — both already direct dependencies here — require. The stale range made consumers nest a second copy of the package under `node_modules/@rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health/`, alongside the hoisted `0.17.3`. That duplicated `zod`, `zod-to-json-schema` and the whole blueprint set in the app bundle, and it is a latent break rather than a cosmetic one: extension data refs and React contexts do not reliably cross copy boundaries, and one consuming app already had to annotate an `ExtensionDefinition` by hand to stop `tsc` failing with `TS2742` on a type it could only name through the nested path. Nothing in the plugin used an API removed in `0.17` — `NavItemBlueprint` is the only casualty and this plugin never referenced it — so the build, lint and all `413` tests pass unchanged.
- changed `delivery-publish` into a matrix over the publishable workspace packages, each publishing from its own directory. Every package carries the same version and is bumped together, so a single tag still gates the whole release
- changed `jest` and `jest-environment-jsdom` to `^30`, `@types/jest` to `^30`, `@testing-library/jest-dom` to `^7`, `jest-junit` to `^17` and `@types/node` to `^26.1.2`. `@backstage/cli@0.36.4` declares `jest ^29 || ^30`, so the runner move is supported rather than tolerated
- changed `nanoid` to `3.3.17` through a resolution, clearing CVE-2026-67213 (HIGH). It reaches the tree through `@backstage/cli` and `postcss`, and the advisory has a patched release, so it is pinned away rather than suppressed
- changed `react-router-dom` from `7.0.0` to `^7.18.2`. The lockfile had been pinned to `7.0.0` since the repository was created and carried nine high-severity advisories — XSS via open redirects, SSR XSS in `ScrollRestoration`, pre-render data spoofing, unauthenticated RCE through the vendored `turbo-stream@2`, and DoS via both `__manifest` path expansion and inefficient route matching. `7.18.2` has none, and drops the vulnerable `turbo-stream` from the tree entirely
- changed `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, all four of which asserted that the plugin had no backend of its own. They now describe the three packages, the catalog-driven discovery, the credential story and the decisions worth not re-litigating — the Azure DevOps API defaults that hide most of the data, why rate-limit headers are read on successful responses, and which history genuinely cannot be backfilled
- changed how the latest Azure DevOps tag is chosen. Its refs API returns tags alphabetically and with no dates at all, so taking the first of the list — which `$top=1` did — reliably returned the _oldest_ version-like tag. Version-shaped names are now compared numerically, with a documented fallback for anything else; resolving true dates would cost one annotated-tag lookup per tag per repository per day
- changed the `react-router-dom` peer range to `^6.30.2 || ^7.0.0`. The plugin never imports it, but every `@backstage/*` package it depends on peers on `^6.30.2`, so the previous `^7.0.0`-only range made a stock Backstage app report an unsatisfiable peer
- changed the coverage configuration to match how `backstage-cli repo test` merges Jest config: the thresholds stay global in the root `package.json`, while `collectCoverageFrom` and `roots` move into each package, because their paths resolve against `<package>/src`
- changed the documented release procedure to the AutoBump command that performs it, replacing a hand-written checklist that named the wrong branch (`bump/x.x.x` rather than the `chore/bump-x.x.x` the tool creates and the pipeline matches on) and left the version edits manual. It also records why the global config has to be named explicitly from this directory, and why a breaking change has to lead its changelog entry to count as one
- changed the enforced coverage thresholds from 90/90/77/90 to 95 lines, 95 statements, 92 functions and 88 branches, against measured 99.2/98.9/97.6/93.6 across the whole package
- changed the GitHub repository name from `code-health` to `backstage-plugin-code-health` so it matches the published package; the npm package name, the plugin id, the `codeHealth` app-config key, the proxy paths and the browser storage keys are all unchanged, so nothing consumers depend on moved
- changed the npm trusted-publishing trust entry to pin the new repository name, since the OIDC `repository` claim is matched against a stored string that a rename does not update
- changed the pinned versions of the patched transitive dependencies: `brace-expansion` to `1.1.18`/`2.1.4`/`5.0.9`, `js-yaml` to `4.3.1` and `undici` to `7.29.0`, clearing the last `yarn npm audit` and Trivy SCA findings
- changed the repository into a Yarn workspaces monorepo, with the frontend plugin moving from the repository root to `plugins/code-health/`. Its npm name, plugin id, entry points and published tarball contents are unchanged, so nothing consumers depend on moved. The root package is now private and drives the workspace through `backstage-cli repo lint|test|build`, which is what keeps the merged coverage report and `junit-report.xml` at the repository root where the shared pipeline reads them. This is groundwork for the backend plugin, which cannot share a package with a frontend one because `backstage.role` is singular and the two build to different targets
- changed the Trivy scan to skip `node_modules`, through a `trivy.yaml` at the repository root. The backend's test dependencies pull in `testcontainers` and, eventually, a C library that vendors its own CI `Dockerfile`s; without this those get scanned as though this repository wrote them. Scoping the walk keeps the four `Dockerfile` checks armed for a `Dockerfile` this repository might genuinely add later, which suppressing the findings by id would not

### Fixed

- fixed the `security > sca:yarn-audit` and `security > sca:trivy` jobs, both of which had been failing on `main`
- fixed the claim that npm accepts a trusted-publishing entry for a name it has never seen. It does not: `npm trust` posts to `/-/package/<name>/trust`, which returns `E404` for a package that does not exist, and npm has no pending-publisher concept. A new name has to be created by one hand publish before CI can ever publish it, which `1.0.1` had recorded backwards
- fixed the installation guide overstating how the sidebar entry appears. The page emits a title and icon and the new frontend system derives a nav entry from those, but an app that replaces the sidebar with its own `NavContentBlueprint` places items explicitly and can drop it silently. The README now names the extension IDs (`page:code-health`, plus the four `api:code-health/*`) that such an app needs for `nav.take(...)` and `app.extensions`, and states outright that there is no `nav-item:code-health` to reference.
- fixed the range the frontend and the backend declare on `@rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health-common`, which was still `^1.0.1`. A caret range does not cross a major, and `-common` has never been published at `1.x` at all, so both packages would have shipped depending on something no registry could resolve. `.autobump.yaml` now carries that range as a version file pattern, so it moves with the release rather than being remembered

### Removed

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** removed every direct provider client from the frontend, together with the per-user credential storage they needed: the AES-GCM encryption, the IndexedDB key store, the settings page, the credential gate and the four platform repository implementations. The browser now calls one endpoint — its own backend — and holds no credential at all. The plugin therefore requires `@rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health-backend` and reads repositories from the Backstage catalog; tokens pasted into the old settings page are gone and are not migrated, because they were per-user and per-browser and have no equivalent on the backend
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** removed the `codeHealth.platform`, `codeHealth.organization`, and every `baseUrl` and `proxyPath` option from the frontend configuration. The catalog decides which repositories exist and the host application's `integrations` block supplies the credentials, so there is nothing left to tell a browser. These keys now fail schema validation and must be removed from `app-config.yaml`
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** removed the `codeHealthAuthApiRef` API and the `/settings` route, replacing them with `codeHealthCoverageApiRef`. An app that referenced `api:code-health/auth` in `app.extensions` must reference `api:code-health/coverage` instead
- removed the `Authorization` header from the backend development harness's own documentation. The harness mocks auth and never needed one, and the example tripped Gitleaks' `curl-auth-header` rule. A `.gitleaksignore` entry covers the commit that already shipped it, with the reasoning recorded beside the fingerprint
- removed the `brace-expansion` suppressions from `.yarnrc.yml` and `.trivyignore`. Upstream backported the DoS fix to every line in the tree on 2026-07-30, so the advisory is now pinned away rather than hidden. The `@octokit/*` and `uuid` entries stay: `@backstage/integration@2.0.3` is still the newest release and still pins `@octokit/rest@^19`, and `@backstage/core-components` still pins `@material-table/core@^3`, whose `require("uuid").default.v4()` call no patched `uuid` supports
- removed the date inputs from the contributors table. The toolbar's range picker is the single control over the window, so the two can no longer disagree about which period is on screen
- removed the unreachable `new URL` guard in the catalog repository resolver. `ScmIntegrations.byUrl` parses the target itself and returns `undefined` when it cannot, so the guard behind it could never run; leaving dead defensive code in place is worse than not having it, because it reads as though a failure mode is handled

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- changed npm publishing to authenticate with OIDC trusted publishing instead of an `NPM_TOKEN` secret, so no long-lived publish credential exists in the repository at all; npm revoked classic tokens in December 2025 and 2FA-bypass tokens lose the ability to publish around January 2027, so token-based automation had no future
- changed the publish job to Node 22 and pinned npm to 11.18.0; the OIDC exchange needs npm 11.5.1 or newer and Node 22 bundles npm 10, so the pin is a deliberate choice above that floor rather than the floor itself

### Fixed

- fixed the `npm trust github` invocation documented in `CLAUDE.md`, which exited with a usage error: the workflow is named with `--file` rather than `--workflow`, and `--allow-publish` has to be passed or the trust entry is created without the permission CI needs
- fixed the claim that npm requires a package to exist before accepting a trust entry; npm accepts one for a name that has never been published and the first CI run creates the package, so the manual bootstrap publish that section described was unnecessary — and impossible as written, since `npm publish --provenance` only generates provenance inside CI
- fixed the release notes to record that a tag push runs the workflow file as it exists at that tag, so a tag cut before a change to `.github/workflows/default.yaml` keeps running the old job and re-pushing it cannot pick the change up

### Removed

- removed the dependency cache from the publish job, so a poisoned cache entry cannot reach the published tarball

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- added `npmMinimalAgeGate: '7d'` to `.yarnrc.yml` so a compromised release has a week to be caught before it can be resolved into this repository
- added `resolutions` pinning the transitive build-tooling dependencies that carry published advisories (`brace-expansion`, `tar`, `fast-uri`, `adm-zip`, `prismjs`) to their first patched release
- added a `delivery > publish:npm` job to `.github/workflows/default.yaml` that publishes the package automatically when a version bump lands on `main`, gated on the same condition the shared workflow uses to cut the tag; it publishes with `npm publish --provenance` and no-ops when the version is already on the registry, so the tag-push recovery path stays safe to re-run
- added a documented `.trivyignore` entry for `CVE-2026-41907` in `uuid` `3.4.0`, which reaches the tree only through `@material-table/core` and cannot be upgraded because that package calls the default export uuid removed in `7.0.0`
- added a theme toggle backed by Backstage's `appThemeApi`, keeping the plugin in sync with the app's theme picker
- added administrator-managed settings — `platform`, `organization`, `refreshIntervalMs` and the Sonar flavour pinned in `app-config.yaml` override user settings and render read-only, with an explanatory note on each affected card
- added an `/alpha` entry point exporting the plugin for Backstage's declarative frontend system, so apps built on `@backstage/frontend-defaults` can list it in `features` like any other plugin; the page mounts through `compatWrapper` and the route through `convertLegacyRouteRef`, matching how the community plugins bridge the two systems
- added Backstage plugin scaffolding: `codeHealthPlugin`, the routable `CodeHealthPage` extension, `rootRouteRef` with `contributors` and `settings` sub-routes, and a `config.d.ts` schema for the `codeHealth` key
- added Backstage proxy support: configuring `proxyPath` for GitHub, Azure DevOps, Sonar or WakaTime routes those calls through the Backstage backend, which attaches the credential, so no token reaches the browser
- added documented `.trivyignore` entries for `CVE-2025-25288`, `CVE-2025-25289` and `CVE-2025-25290` in the `@octokit` packages that `@backstage/core-compat-api` pulls in transitively; `@backstage/integration` still pins the affected octokit majors in its latest release, so there is nothing to upgrade to
- added four Backstage utility APIs (`codeHealthAuthApiRef`, `codeHealthConfigApiRef`, `codeHealthRepositoriesApiRef`, `codeHealthContributorsApiRef`) so an integrator can swap any of them for their own implementation

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** converted the project from a standalone GitHub Pages single-page app into the publishable Backstage frontend plugin `@rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health`; `yarn build` now emits a library in `dist/` instead of a deployable site, and the GitHub Pages deployment job was removed
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** downgraded React from `19` to `18` and added `react-router-dom` `v6`, matching the peer ranges of `@backstage/core-plugin-api` and `@backstage/core-components`
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** narrowed `DashboardService` and `ContributorService` to take no credentials — tokens and the target organization are now resolved internally from app-config and user settings; the platform-specific implementations moved behind `PlatformDashboardService` and `PlatformContributorService`
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** renamed the project from `gitforge-dashboard` to `code-health` — the repository, the npm package (`@rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health`), the plugin id, the `codeHealth` app-config key, the browser storage keys and every exported symbol. "Forge" named the systems the plugin reads from rather than what it tells you about them
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** replaced Tailwind CSS with Material UI `v4` and `@backstage/core-components` so the dashboard inherits the host app's theme; `Page`, `Header` and `TabbedLayout` now provide the navigation that the custom `Navigation` component used to
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** replaced the Vite/Vitest toolchain with the Backstage CLI — `backstage-cli package build` (plus `tsc` for the declarations it consumes), `package lint` and `package test`; the suite now runs on Jest and the package publishes the standard `dist/index.esm.js` + `dist/index.d.ts` layout through `publishConfig`
- changed every HTTP client to go through Backstage's `fetchApi` and a proxy-aware `EndpointResolver` instead of calling `fetch` with hard-coded base URLs, and repositories now receive their client through the constructor
- changed the credential store to initialize lazily behind `DeferredAuthenticationService`, so the encrypted store can be exposed as a synchronous Backstage utility API and a failing key store degrades to the setup screen instead of breaking the app
- changed the two reusable Claude workflows to pass `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` explicitly instead of `secrets: inherit`, so they no longer receive every repository secret

### Removed

- removed `vite`, `vitest`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `jsdom` and the standalone ESLint 9 flat config, all superseded by the Backstage CLI
- removed the standalone app entry points (`index.html`, `src/main/main.tsx`, `src/main/app.tsx`, `src/index.css`) and the `Navigation`, `DashboardHeader` and `LoginPage` components they carried
- removed the Tailwind toolchain (`tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/vite`)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- added `knip.json` with `ignoreExportsUsedInFile: true` so types exported only for same-file consumption (e.g. `CIFilter`, `ReleaseFilter`, `GraphQLResponse`, `AdoPullRequestIdentity`, `AdoPullRequestReviewer`) are not falsely reported as unused

### Changed

- refreshed `CLAUDE.md` to fix pipeline reference from `yarn.yaml` to `yarn-library.yaml` in Deployment section

### Removed

- removed unused `EMPTY_SONAR_METRICS` constant from `src/domain/entities/sonar_metrics.ts` (flagged by `quality:knip`)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- refreshed `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to fix `npm` → `yarn` commands, replace outdated file tree with high-level architecture, and update platform/integration descriptions

- added Settings page with per-integration token management for VCS, Sonar, and WakaTime
- added V8 coverage thresholds in `vite.config.ts` enforcing 80%+ statements/functions/lines and 75%+ branches
- added Web Crypto AES-GCM encryption layer for token storage in `localStorage`

### Changed

- changed approved PR counting to use only APPROVED review state instead of merged state fallback
- changed CI workflow to follow the standard `default.yaml` pattern with named workflow, permission comments, and `default` job name
- changed CI workflow to use the new `yarn.yaml` reusable workflow from `rios0rios0/pipelines` (replacing deprecated `javascript.yaml`)
- changed coverage thresholds from 80/80/75/80 to 90/90/77/90 (lines/functions/branches/statements) in `vite.config.ts`
- changed DI wiring to create repositories and services dynamically based on selected platform
- changed sortable table headers to use `<button>` with `aria-sort` for keyboard and screen-reader accessibility

### Fixed

- fixed `LoadingSkeleton` column count mismatch (13 vs 12 table headers)
- fixed `onRefetchRef` side effect during render phase by moving it to `useEffect`
- fixed `SonarCloudRepositoryImpl` and `NoOpSonarCloudRepository` method signatures to match interface contract
- fixed TypeScript circular type inference in contributor repository GraphQL pagination loop
