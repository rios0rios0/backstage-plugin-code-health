 * One bucket of a person's history.
 *
 * The score is computed rather than invented, by the same function the backend
 * uses, so a test asserting on a chart of scores is asserting on the arithmetic
 * that actually ships. The reference defaults to the bucket's own row, which
 * makes a lone contributor the top figure in their own window — the shape a
 * one-person fixture would really have.
 *
 * The capabilities default to none for the same reason the backend's do: a
 * fixture that says nothing about integrations is a fixture for an install with
 * none configured, and the score it carries has to be that install's.
