/**
 * Confluence's three card sets, split by what each one is a question about.
 *
 * What the fleet wrote stays on Insights; who wrote it sits above the
 * contributors table and where the wiki has rotted above the repositories
 * table, beside the rows each of them names.
 *
 * All three are deliberately their own cards rather than more tiles on "At a
 * glance": documentation is a different kind of work from shipping code,
 * measured over a different window, and mixing the two would put a 90-day
 * figure beside a seven-day one with nothing on screen saying so. They render
 * as `Grid` items so each page keeps one grid and one set of breakpoints.
