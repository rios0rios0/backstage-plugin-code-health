 * contributors table and the ranking of repositories above the repositories
 * table, because a ranking is a way *into* a row and a tab away from the rows
 * it ranks makes a reader carry a name across the screen by hand.
 *
 * All three are rendered as `Grid item` children so each page composes them
 * into its own grid, and so a fleet without WakaTime is a section that is never
 * built rather than one full of empty cards.

 * on the Insights tab counts things a version control provider produced — a
 * commit, a merged pull request, a green pipeline — and none of them can see
 * the afternoon somebody spent reading code that produced no commit at all.
 *
 * The three breakdowns share one card and one row of columns rather than being
 * spread across the page: they are three cuts of the same total, and reading
 * them side by side is the point — an hour that shows up under "code
 * reviewing" is also an hour in some language, in some editor.
