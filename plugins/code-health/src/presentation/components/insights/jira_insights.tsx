 * The delivery figures answer for the fleet and stay on Insights; the two
 * rankings of people sit above the contributors table and the three views of
 * the backlog above the repositories table, beside the rows each of them names.
 *
 * All three are rendered as loose `Grid item` children rather than as one card,
 * so each drops into the page's existing grid instead of building a second page
 * inside the first. Each is mounted only when the backend reports the Jira
 * capability, which is why nothing here checks configuration: a switched off
 * integration never reaches this file at all.
