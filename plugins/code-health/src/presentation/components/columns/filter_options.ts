/**
 * The filter vocabulary every table shares, in one place.
 *
 * The repositories table and the owned-repositories card render the same facts
 * through the same `DataTable`, so a reader who filters Compliance by
 * "Non-compliant" on the tab and clicks into a person has to find that same
 * word on their card. When these lists were written out in both files they
 * diverged the moment one was corrected — which is the argument for them being
 * one list rather than two that agree today.
 *
 * Every label is the word the column's own badge renders, not a second
 * vocabulary invented for the filter: the selects used to offer the stored
 * values, so Compliance said `red` while the chip one cell away said
 * "Non-compliant" and left the reader to pair them up.

/**
 * How every select words the rows no snapshot has reached.
 *
 * One wording for all of them, because it is one fact about the row rather
 * than a state of each column. The *value* behind it differs — `none` here,
 * `unknown` there, `NONE` for Sonar — because each accessor already folded
 * null to its own sentinel, which is why offering the option was all these
 * needed: the filter matched it all along and nothing put it on screen.
