 * Everything cheap here is therefore a count, and everything that had to
 * attribute work to a person cost a walk — which is why the counts are plain
 * numbers while the attributed figures go null the moment a cap bites.
 *
 * Three things this deliberately does not do, each because the API cannot:
 *
 * - **Lines.** Confluence serves no diff between two versions and no change
 *   size anywhere in either API generation. Written volume is measured in
 *   words, from the length of the body either side of an edit, and the unit is
 *   carried on the payload so the dashboard never prints a figure it did not
 *   measure.
 * - **Page views on a Standard site.** The analytics API is Confluence Cloud
 *   Premium only. The first refusal is treated as a verdict about the whole
 *   site and remembered, because a plan does not change between two requests in
 *   one pass, and views stay null rather than becoming zero.
 * - **Backlinks.** Nothing in Confluence Cloud REST answers "what links here",
 *   so what the space report calls `parentlessPages` is exactly that, and is
 *   not dressed up as an orphan count.
