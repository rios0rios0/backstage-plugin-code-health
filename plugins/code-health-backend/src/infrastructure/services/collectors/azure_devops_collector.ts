 * commits keep the dates they were committed on, so the branch history for the
 * day of the merge never returns them, and the day they were committed was
 * fetched before they were on the branch. The rebase-and-merge hides them for
 * the same reason once the branch was rebased onto the target before it was
 * completed, which is what a policy that demands an up-to-date branch makes
 * everyone do: Azure DevOps then has nothing left to rewrite and replays the
 * commits with the dates they already had. That is why this follows the
 * strategy attribution ends up with rather than the name the provider used —
 * whatever is dropped as a merge commit has to be asked for, or the work it
 * carried is lost. A squash writes one new commit on the branch and a rebase
 * rewrites the commits onto it with new committer dates — the date both the
 * provider's filter and this collector go by — so neither needs asking. Those
 * dates are when Azure DevOps prepared the merge, which can be hours before the
 * completion put the commits on the branch; the ingestion's incremental overlap
 * is what reads that span again once they are there.
 *
 * With no completion options at all the completion was a plain merge, which is
 * what Azure DevOps does when nothing says otherwise; `squashMerge` is the
 * boolean `mergeStrategy` replaced. A strategy this plugin does not know keeps
 * whatever the provider stamped, because guessing either way could lose work.
