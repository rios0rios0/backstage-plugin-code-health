/**
 * One request allowance per source, for one snapshot pass.
 *
 * The pass used to hand every source one budget, and the enrichers drew from
 * it before a single repository was captured. Their own ceilings — five hundred
 * Confluence version histories, a thousand Jira issues per project — could
 * each exceed the whole allowance on their own, so one moderately large space
 * left the repository loop, which is the only part of the pass nothing else
 * can record, with nothing at all. Worse, it did so silently and deterministically:
 * the same tail of repositories was skipped on every run, and annotating one
 * component with a large space changed what was captured for every other one.
 *
 * Separate allowances are the fix. A source that spends everything it was
 * given stops on its own and touches nothing else; what each one spent is
 * reported by name, so an operator reading the completion line can see where
 * the requests went rather than inferring it from a total.
 *
 * A source the pass was not given is still answered with a budget, of nothing,
 * so a caller can build every context up front; it is left out of the summary
 * because a zero for an integration nobody configured says nothing.
