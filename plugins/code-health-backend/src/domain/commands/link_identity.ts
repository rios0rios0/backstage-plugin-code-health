 * Attaches an account to a catalog user, or detaches it again.

 * Both halves are verified before anything is written. An account nobody has
 * observed and a user the catalog does not hold both produce a link that
 * silently matches nothing — the contributor row would look exactly as it did
 * before, and the person who made the link would have no way to tell it had not
 * worked. Failing loudly at the moment of the mistake is the only point at
 * which it is cheap to fix.
 *
 * The reference is checked for shape here rather than left to the catalog,
 * which throws on an unparseable one — a bare name typed into the link field
 * would otherwise surface as a 500 instead of the "told plainly that it does
 * not exist" the screen promises.
