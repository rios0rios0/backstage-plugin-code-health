 * back through a year it never observed.
 *
 * The repository loop is the only part of the pass nothing else can record, so
 * the pass is built around it. Every source spends an allowance of its own:
 * the enrichers used to draw on one shared budget before a single repository
 * was captured, and one moderately large Confluence space could leave the loop
 * with nothing — silently, and for the same repositories every night, because
 * the loop walked the tracked set in a fixed order and stopped where the
 * allowance ran out. The loop now takes the repositories the last pass never
 * reached first, and a pass that stops short says how many it left.
 *
 * The loop runs before the contributor sweeps for the same reason. The
 * allowances bound the requests, not the minutes, and the task's timeout is
 * shared: a Confluence sweep that walks five hundred version histories should
 * time out having stored the day's snapshots rather than before the first one.
 * Only the per-repository figures Jira and Confluence contribute go ahead of
 * the loop, because they ride on the snapshot row itself — and the Confluence
 * ones spend an allowance sized per annotated space, so what sits ahead of
 * the loop is bounded by the annotation count rather than by the sweep's caps.
 *
 * The pass shares one project cache across repositories, which is what turns
 * Azure DevOps branch policies from a per-repository download into a
 * per-project one.
