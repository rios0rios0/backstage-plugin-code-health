# @rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health-backend

The Backstage **backend** plugin of the Code Health suite.

It discovers repositories from the Backstage catalog, authenticates through the host application's
existing `integrations` configuration, ingests a year of their history in a rate-limited background
job, stores it in the Backstage database, and serves it to the frontend plugin under
`/api/code-health`.

Install it alongside `@rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health`:

```ts
// packages/backend/src/index.ts
backend.add(import('@rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health-backend'));
```

See the [repository README](https://github.com/rios0rios0/backstage-plugin-code-health#readme)
for configuration, the scheduled tasks and the operational notes.

## Trends and ownership

Three routes answer a question about one row of the dashboard rather than about the fleet:

| Route | Answers |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/contributors/:key/trend?from&to&bucket` | One person's history, bucketed by `day`, `week` or `month` — the same row the contributors table shows, aggregated over each bucket, with the productivity score it earned |
| `GET /v1/repositories/:id/trend?from&to&bucket` | One repository's history on the same terms, with its health score |
| `GET /v1/contributors/:key/repositories?from&to` | The repositories the person is **responsible for** |

`:key` is a contributor row's key, so it is percent-encoded: a linked person's key is a catalog
reference such as `user%3Adefault%2Fjane`, and an unlinked account's is `vcs%3Ajane%40acme.com`.

Every bucket of a person's trend is scored against **the fleet in that same bucket**, not against
the whole window. A score is a share of the top figure anybody recorded in the same period, so a
quiet week beside one exceptional week reads as a quiet week rather than as a collapse. A bucket the
person did nothing in still gets a point — an all-zero row carrying their name — because closing
over a fortnight off would draw it as a shorter, busier month.

Sonar, compliance and badge figures on a trend come from the most recent daily snapshot at or before
each bucket's last day, filled forward when a snapshot task missed a run. None of them can be
backfilled, so those series begin at the first snapshot after installation.

Responsibility is the catalog's `spec.owner`, read by discovery and stored on the repository row
beside the other catalog facts. It is matched against the person's own `User` entity, every `Group`
they are a member of and the parents of those groups — the same expansion Backstage's own identity
performs. A row nobody has linked to a catalog user owns nothing and says so with an empty `owners`,
because "owns no repositories" and "not attached to anybody yet" are different conversations.

## Administrators

One thing on the dashboard is not a read: an administrator can start the history collection over and
choose how far back it reaches.

```yaml
codeHealth:
  administrators:
    - user:default/jane
    - group:default/platform
```

Entity references of catalog users or groups. A bare name defaults to a user, so `jane` means
`user:default/jane`. **The list is empty by default, which means nobody** — a reset drops every
collected commit, pull request, review and build and re-walks the providers, which is hours of
rate-limited requests, so it is not something an install should acquire by upgrading.

There are two levers and both have to open:

- **The list** is what makes the restriction real on a stock install. Backstage's default permission
  policy allows everything, so the framework alone cannot say "administrators only".
- **The permission** `code-health.ingestion.reset` is what lets an installed policy, or the RBAC
  plugin, veto the reset — including for somebody the list names. It is exported as
  `codeHealthIngestionResetPermission` so a policy can name what it is deciding about.

| Route | Answers |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/access` | `{ canResetIngestion, retentionDays }` for the caller. Never a 403: a page asks this before deciding whether to draw a button, and a service principal or an anonymous decision simply reads `false` |
| `POST /v1/ingestion/reset` | Body `{ days }`, a whole number from 1 to the configured `codeHealth.ingestion.retentionDays`. `403` when the caller is not an administrator, `400` when `days` is out of range |

A reset, in one transaction per run, sends every **tracked** repository back to where a fresh install
starts: it deletes the commits, pull requests, reviews and builds the walk re-collects, forgets the
days those repositories claimed as fetched, and sets the backfill floor to the reach that was asked
for. It then triggers the ingestion task.

What it **keeps**: snapshots, releases and tags, which come from the daily snapshot rather than from
the walk and which nothing would ever put back; and the history of a repository that has left the
catalog, which is never ingested again.

Afterwards the dashboard behaves as it does after installation — the last day is answerable from the
first run, and wider ranges unlock as the backfill advances.

## Optional integrations

Each one is absent unless it is configured, and the frontend asks which are on before it draws a
column. Every reference below covers exactly what is measured, how each number is derived, and what
the provider cannot answer:

- [WakaTime](docs/wakatime.md) — coding time, language and editor breakdowns, branches, and AI
  token counts
- [Jira](docs/jira.md) — tickets, interactions, story points, cycle and lead time
- [Confluence](docs/confluence.md) — pages, written volume, comments and page views

All three report people under account systems that agree with neither each other nor the catalog, so
a contributor row is a **person** rather than an account. The `Identities` screen is where an account
is attached to a catalog `User`; the WakaTime reference explains the rules that screen applies, and
they are the same for every source.
