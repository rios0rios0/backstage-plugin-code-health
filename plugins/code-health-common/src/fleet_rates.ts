/**
 * The team's **mean daily rate** for every measure the Averages card prints,
 * and how many people it was taken over.
 *
 * This is {@link FleetReference} — the reference the productivity score reads
 * output against — with two additions the score never needed and one
 * distinction it could afford to blur. Pull requests opened and pipeline runs
 * are not components of the score, but they are rows on the card, and a card
 * that compared six of its eight rows against the team would leave a reader
 * wondering what was wrong with the other two. And where the reference folds
 * "measured on nobody" into a zero, because a zero reference reads as
 * unmeasurable in every score, the card has to tell the two apart: a team in
 * which nobody has WakaTime linked has no average coding time, and printing a
 * zero for it would report a team that never opens an editor.
 *
 * Every figure is per elapsed day over the same window the person's own rates
 * are taken over, so the two sides of the comparison are always in one unit.
 * `null` is measured on nobody, never a rate of nothing.
