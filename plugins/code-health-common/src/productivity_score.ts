/**
 * A person's productivity over a window, as one number with its workings.
 *
 * These figures are read as a measure of people, so what goes into the number
 * matters more than the number. Four rules decide it:
 *
 * - **Output is a rate, measured against the fleet's average rate.** Commits,
 *   merged pull requests, churn and reviews — and, wherever the integration is
 *   configured, coding time, resolved tickets and documentation written — are
 *   divided by the days the window spans and read against the *mean* rate
 *   across the people measured in it, with twice that mean scoring full marks.
 *   A quiet month for the whole team is then a quiet month rather than
 *   everybody's failure, and there is no invented "forty commits is a good
 *   month" to argue with.
 *
 *   The mean, not the maximum. Against the top figure, one person having an
 *   extraordinary month pushed everybody else's score down for reasons that
 *   had nothing to do with them, and a single automation nobody had excluded
 *   yet could flatten a whole team at once. Against the mean, keeping pace
 *   with the team scores half, doubling it scores full, and one outlier moves
 *   the reference by a fraction of its own size instead of setting it outright.
 *
 *   A rate, not a total, so that every figure means the same thing whatever
 *   range was picked: "0.8 commits a day" is comparable with last quarter's
 *   reading, where "12 commits" is only comparable against another twelve
 *   weeks. The division cancels out of the comparison itself, so the score is
 *   the same number either way — what it buys is the wording and the Averages
 *   card, not a different result.
 *
 *   It does **not** correct for tenure or absence, and must not be described as
 *   though it did. Everybody is divided by the same window, so somebody who
 *   joined halfway through it carries half the total and half the rate, and
 *   scores half of a colleague who worked at the same pace throughout. Only a
 *   per-person denominator — the days that person was actually active — would
 *   remove that, and it brings its own distortion: one day worked and two
 *   commits made would read as twice as productive as a steady month.
 * - **Reliability and quality are absolute.** A pipeline success rate, a
 *   quality gate, and the share of somebody's resolved tickets that stayed
 *   resolved mean the same thing whoever else is on the team.
 * - **What was not measured is left out, never scored as zero.** Somebody whose
 *   pipeline never ran has no success rate; somebody working on a repository
 *   with no Sonar project has an unknown gate; somebody with no WakaTime
 *   account linked to them has no coding time. Their weight goes to the
 *   components that could be measured, and `evidence` says how much survived.
 * - **Which components exist at all is decided by configuration.** An
 *   integration the backend was never configured with contributes no component
 *   rather than an unmeasured one, and the rest are renormalised over what is
 *   left. Inferring it from whether a row happens to carry a value cannot tell
 *   a switched-off integration from one that is on and has collected nothing
 *   yet, which would make a freshly configured install look as though half its
 *   people had stopped working.
 *
 * Sonar figures on a contributor row describe the repositories the person
 * changed the code of, not what they wrote — the same reading the table gives
 * them — which is why those two components carry the least weight.
 */

/**
 * The fleet's **mean daily rate** for each relative component, and the window
 * those rates were taken over.
 *
 * A mean rather than a maximum, and per day rather than per window — see the
 * reasoning on {@link ProductivityScore}. `days` travels with the figures
 * because every sentence the score produces is phrased as a rate, and a rate
 * separated from the period it was taken over is a number nobody can check.
 *
 * Churn is kept per unit because the two providers do not report the same
 * thing: GitHub reports lines, Azure DevOps reports files, and a person on one
 * platform is only ever compared with people measured in their own unit.
 *
 * Each mean is taken over the rows the component could be *measured* on, not
 * over everybody. A row whose metrics are null has not recorded a zero —
 * nothing was ever asked on its behalf — and averaging silence in as zero drags
 * the reference down towards nothing, which would flatter every row that does
 * carry a figure. It is the same rule the maximum followed, and it matters more
 * here: a maximum ignores a wrong zero, a mean is moved by every one of them.
 *
 * The version-control figures follow the same rule through the row's
 * identities rather than through a null, because they have none: somebody
 * known only to Jira carries `commits: 0`, and that zero used to go into the
 * commit mean and lower the bar every real committer was read against. Only a
 * row with a version-control account is measured for commits, pull requests
 * and reviews — and on such a row a zero is a real zero, a quiet window.

/**
 * The components a given install actually scores on, weighted to sum to one.
 *
 * Exported because the number and every sentence explaining it have to come
 * from the same place. The weights move with configuration — with all three
 * integrations on, commits carry 0.2/1.4, about 14%, rather than 20% — so a
 * column header, a card subheader or a page of documentation that wrote those
 * percentages out by hand would be wrong on most installs, and wrong in a way
 * nobody would ever notice.
 *
 * `weights` is one role's nominal set, the engineer's by default. A set whose
 * enabled components all weigh nothing yields every component at zero rather
 * than dividing by it, and the score then reads as unmeasured.
